#Hello, this is vishak and this document is for a step by step setup for Vim 
# and CLI development environment.

#First just clone the repository and replace(if it already exists then make a backup li#ke so, copy and paste this : mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrcbak) the .vimrc file then move the fi

#Move the downloaded .vimrc file to the ~/ directory of the /.vim folder ( which ever you prefer).

#The .vimrc file is pretty simple to read and has basic configurations for Vim. 
#Keep in mind that it uses Vundle to install the plugins. 

# For a quick start and Install of the Vundle.vim plugin please go through this 
# https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git 
# I found it extremely useful and you will too, it is very easy to follow.

#This file set has configurations for Vim, specifically for Ruby, tmux configs and zsh #shell configurations. I have not personalised my colorschemes but used the standard
#plugins from other Git Repos.
